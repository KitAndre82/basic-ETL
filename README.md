### Creating a simple ETL using Python and Divvy Bikes Data 

#### Overview

This project aims to analyze the Divvy bike-sharing system's data to derive insights into bike usage patterns, user behavior, and temporal trends. The analysis encompasses data from 2018, covering all four quarters of the year. 

##### The main objectives include:

Combining multiple CSV files containing trip data into a single dataset.

Aggregating and summarizing trip information by day of the week, quarter, month, and hour.

Visualizing key metrics to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

#### Project Structure

##### The repository is structured as follows:

Scripts: Includes the Python scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

Results: Stores the output files generated during the analysis, such as pivot tables and visualizations.

README.md: This document, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

#### Results
divvy_bikes_datawarehouse.xlsx: Excel file containing the pivot table summarizing bike trip data by various dimensions such as date, quarter, month, day of the week, hour, and user type.

Plots: Directory containing visualizations generated from the analysis, including histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, and line plots.

#### Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve the analysis and enhance its capabilities.
